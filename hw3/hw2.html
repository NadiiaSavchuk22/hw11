            <p class="article_main">
                HTML5 has revolutionized the way we consume multimedia content on the web. With HTML5, web developers
                can create immersive and interactive multimedia experiences that rival those of traditional desktop
                applications. However, with great power comes great responsibility. As the amount of multimedia content
                on the web grows, so does the need to organize and manage it effectively. This is where multimedia tags
                in HTML5 come in.

                In HTML5, multimedia tags are used to embed audio, video, and other types of multimedia content into web
                pages. These tags provide a standardized way of playing multimedia content across different browsers and
                devices. However, multimedia tags are not just for playback; they also serve as a way to organize and
                manage multimedia content.

                In HTML5, there are several multimedia tags that can be used to embed different types of media, such as
                audio and video, into web pages. These tags include:

                is a representation of information in an attractive and interactive manner with the use of a combination
                of text, audio, video, graphics and animation. In other words we can say that Multimedia is a
                computerized method of presenting information combining textual data, audio, visuals (video), graphics
                and animations.
                <hr>
                Multimedia comes in many different formats. It can be almost anything you can hear or see, like images,
                music, sound, videos, records, films, animations, and more.
                <br>

                    Web pages often contain multimedia elements of different types and formats.

                    The first web browsers had support for text only, limited to a single font in a single color. Later
                    came browsers with support for colors, fonts, images, and multimedi

                <p>
                    Multimedia elements (like audio or video) are stored in media files.
                    The most common way to discover the type of a file, is to look at the file extension.

                    Multimedia files have formats and different extensions like:
                    <strong>
                        .wav, .mp3, .mp4, .mpg, .wmv, and .avi.

                    HTML provides extensive multimedia support with elements like img, audio, video, and iframe. These
                    elements allow developers to create rich, interactive websites that can handle various forms of
                    media natively, without the need for plugins. Whether it's embedding images, playing audio,
                    displaying video, or integrating external content, HTML makes multimedia integration both easy and
                    efficient.

                    The amount of information contained in one single frame can take three pages to describe. It is a
                    known fact that people engage more when they watch a video and tend to stay watching it. They are
                    also happy to pass it along. Video informs and entertains people and, good or bad, today most people
                    prefer to watch a video rather than read a page of text.
